excerpt: 'Prior studies have extensively exhibited an interest in exploring the connectedness between dirty and clean energy stock prices alongside the drivers of such price connectedness, shedding light on hedging strategies for finance practitioners. Nevertheless, no empirical research has examined whether climate risks, the emerging indicator for investors to handle the divestment of dirty energy stocks, have affected the time-varying dirty-clean energy equity price nexus. This study fills this gap by innovatively identifying dynamic conditional correlations (DCCs) between dirty and clean energy stock prices. an ARDL/NARDL model is applied to assess whether the climate risks affect such correlations by controlling for business cycles, funding liquidity, USD values, and oil market sentiments. The NARDL model bounds test results indicate that crude oil and corn prices have a long-run connection with livestock prices in both sub-periods. In the post-break period, corn price has an asymmetric effect on cattle price in the long-run, with negative shocks in the corn price leading to a greater intensity on the cattle price than positive shocks. The presence of short-run asymmetry is evident in the impacts of crude oil price on both cattle and hog prices. However, the above asymmetric effect is insignificant in the pre-break period.'
