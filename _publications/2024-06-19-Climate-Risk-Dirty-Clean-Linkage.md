excerpt: 'Prior studies have extensively exhibited an interest in exploring the connectedness between dirty and clean energy stock prices alongside the drivers of such price connectedness, shedding light on hedging strategies for finance practitioners. Nevertheless, no empirical research has examined whether climate risks, the emerging indicator for investors to handle the divestment of dirty energy stocks, have affected the time-varying dirty-clean energy equity price nexus. This study fills this gap by innovatively identifying dynamic conditional correlations (DCCs) between dirty and clean energy stock prices. an ARDL/NARDL model is applied to assess whether the climate risks affect such correlations by controlling for business cycles, funding liquidity, USD values, and oil market sentiments. Overall, we detect an undeniable negative impact of climate risks on the positive dirty-clean energy stock price dynamic correlations. Additionally, the NARDL model results reveal that a rise in federal fund rates exerts higher effects on the dirty-clean energy stock price comovements. for monetary policies' asymmetric effects on clean energy investment.'
